# AI-Games-Python

A collection of classic AI-driven simulations implemented in Python. Each game demonstrates fundamental artificial intelligence techniques such as search algorithms and path planning, with interactive visualizations and commentary for step-by-step understanding.

## Contents

This repository includes the following simulation-based games:

### 1. [Autonomous Vacuum Simulation](./Autonomous_Vacuum_Simulation)

A vacuum cleaner moves across a grid, cleans dirt, and returns to base using heuristic navigation.

### 2. [Monkey and Banana Simulation](./Monkey_Banana_Simulation)

A monkey searches for a table and then collects bananas from the grid using simple goal-directed behavior.

### 3. [Water Jug Simulation](./Water_Jug_Simulation)

Solves the classic water jug problem using breadth-first search, showing each operation visually.

### 4. [8-Puzzle Simulation](./8-Puzzle_Simulation)

Solves the sliding tile puzzle using A* search, visualizing each move from initial to goal state.

## How to Run

Each simulation includes:
- A Python script with the simulation logic.
- A `README.md` file with usage instructions.
- A demo video and thumbnail image.

To run any simulation:
1. Open the respective folder.
2. Launch the Python script in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the input prompts to begin.

> These simulations use `IPython.display` for visuals and are best viewed in notebook-based environments.
